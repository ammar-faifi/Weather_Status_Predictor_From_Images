# Binary Classification: sunny vs. cloudy

## About

This is an online ML-based weather status predictor from captured images.
You can upload an outdoors image to predict the probability of each class.

## Models and Algorithms

For the ML details I used the following algorithms:

- KNN \- 63.3%
- LogisticRegression \- 67.8%
- DecisionTree \- 69.1%
- DecisionTree with Bagging \- 73%
- RandomForest \- 74%
- GradientBoosting \- 93.0%

The one used in this predictor is the Tunned Gradient Boosting model.
