# 5-Class Predictor with CNN

## About

`Tensorflow` with `keras`' Sequential model were used.
Unlike the ML one, this model was trained with the entire 18K-image dataset.
The fed image's dimensions is 200x200 pixels, each with 3-channel color. The
maximum accuracy achieved on the validation set is 73%. It can be improved with some
optimizations as applying image augmentation.
